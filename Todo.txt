Future:
 * Move code used for FileBrowser to Advanced List view (Copy CF's Mixer)
 * Use new AdvancedList view for Select

 * Optimize I/O and reduce reading from disk
 * Scrolling with pageup/down

 * Fix thread so it can read init variable (Try re-using timer functions from Mixer area)

 * BBE Presets?

 * EPG / RadioEPG?


Can't be done:
 * Utilize CF's volume slider at the bottom (Boards own volume control)
